# Data Redundancy Removal System

## Internship
This project is developed as part of the CodeAlpha Python Internship.

## Description
A Python-based system that validates data and prevents duplicate entries
from being stored using hash comparison.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- JSON
- SHA-256 Hashing

## How It Works
1. Validates incoming data
2. Generates unique hash
3. Checks redundancy
4. Stores only unique records
# Data Redundancy Management System

## Description
This project prevents duplicate records by validating new entries 
before storing them in a JSON file. It ensures that each record has 
a unique ID to maintain data integrity.

## Features
- Detects and blocks duplicate entries
- Stores records in JSON format
- Simple command-line interface for easy testing

## Technologies Used
- Python
- JSON

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or Codespace.
2. Make sure `data_store.json` exists in the project folder.
3. Run the program in terminal:
4. Enter the required details:
- ID (must be unique)
- Name
- Email
5. The program will confirm if the entry was added or blocked as duplicate.
